# The Complete Web Developer in 2018 course - Startup Landing page
## Tech/framework used
**Built with** *HTML-CSS*

# Overview
   In this project I was given an exercise to create a landing page with the knowledge i've got by going through the **CSS** and **BOOTSTRAP** section of the Complete Web developer in 2018 course made by ***Andrei Neagoie***
 


### To do :

  - Create a fully responsive startup landing page with the files provided by the instructor
  - Add a sign up form with Mailchimp
 #### Side note
   ***
I did not follow the course with the default files and have decided to test my knowledge by creating a startup page from scratch by myself with my own files and images without any code being coppied from the course.
